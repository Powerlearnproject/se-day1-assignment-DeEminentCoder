Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering.

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANS: Software engineering is the practice of designing, developing, and managing computer software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.                                                                                              

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANS: -Emergence of the first digital computer (1940s - 1950s): This era is the transition from mechanical computation devices to fully electronic.                                         -The Introduction of structured programming (1960s - 1970s): This laid the foundation for modern programming practices by introducing the concept of breaking down programs into smaller, manageable units or modules.
-The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s-Present): 
                                                                                                                          

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANS:
-Waterfall is linear and sequential while Agile is iterative and incremental.
-Waterfall when modified can be difficult to accommodate while Agile welcomes changes at any stage.
-Waterfall documentation is extensive and comprehensive while Agile is minimal i.e it focuses on working software.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ANS: SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: are responsible for writing and implementing the code and features that makes up a software application.

QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: are responsible for ensuring that the software meets the required quality standard before it is released to users. They identify issues, bugs and inconsistencies within the software and work closely with developers to resolved them.

PROJECT MANAGER: is responsible for planning, executing and closing projects. They ensure that projects stays on schedule, within the budget and meet the stakeholders'

  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: offer advanced code editors with syntax highlighting, auto completion and code formatting features. E.g Visual Studio Code(VS Code)
VCS: allows developers to track and manage changes to the source code over time. E.g Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ANS: 
Changing Requirements: When requirements change during development, it can cause the project to grow beyond its original scope and lead to delays.
Technical Debts: Taking shortcuts or using less than ideal solutions can create problems that make future development more expensive.                  
  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ANS: Prompt engineering is the process of carefully crafting prompts to interact with AI models.
IMPORTANCE:
Well designed prompts guide the model to generate more precise and relevant answers and ensure that the response aligns with the user's intent.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANS: Tell me about the earth.
IMPROVED...: Explain how the earth revolved round the sun.
